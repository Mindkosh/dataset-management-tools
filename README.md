There are two ways to open a dataset.
1. Choose an image directory - File->Load from Image directory -- This opens up the images in the directory without any labels
2. Choose a COCO dataset json file - File->Load from Dataset file -- This opens the source images and draws the labels on them.
3. If you've opened the labeled dataset file, you can also save all labeled images by going to File -> Export Images with Dataset
